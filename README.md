# Lisa's Resume

This is a jQuery-based resume template that reads all data from a JSON file and modifies the DOM to display the information. I customized the original project layout by personalizing the design using jQuery and CSS

## To install

Download all of the files and copy into a directory maintaining the current directory structure.

## To use

1) Update the resume data in the resumeBuilder.js file
2) Update the title tag in the index.html file
4) Update the headshot and project images; also update the file names in the resumeBuilder.js file
3) Update the styles to personalize
